# dollaridoodle
Image generation but instead of an AI doing it, a real human is drawing it for food money.

Every doodle will be on the same canvas with labels kinda like [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place)

I made this to hopefully make some money for my studies and more eqipments to make more stuffs like this!
